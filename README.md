# Titandork - Google Dorking Automation Tool

Titandork is a powerful and easy-to-use tool designed for security researchers and penetration testers. It automates Google dorking to find sensitive information and vulnerabilities on websites using predefined Google search queries (dorks). With Titandork, you can quickly scan a target domain for potential exposures such as configuration files, admin login pages, backup files, and more.

## Features
- Perform Google dorking on any domain to find:
  - Exposed configuration files (`.env`, `.ini`, `.cfg`)
  - Exposed credentials (passwords, API keys)
  - Database dumps (`.sql`, `.db`)
  - Sensitive documents (`.xls`, `.csv`, `.pdf`)
  - Publicly accessible admin panels
  - Backup files and source code
  - Debug information and error logs
- Saves the results in a timestamped output file for easy reference.
- Color-coded terminal output for clear visual feedback (green for results, red for no results).
- Built-in delay to avoid Google CAPTCHA detection.

## Usage
Once installed, you can start using Titandork by typing the following command in your terminal:

### Output
Titandork will generate an output file for each scan. The output file will be stored in the same directory where the tool is run and named as dorking_results_YYYYMMDD.txt.

for example: **dorking_results_20240924.txt**

This file will contain all the results from the dorking process, making it easy to review the findings later.

```
git pull origin main
